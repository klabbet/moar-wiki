## Introduction

The Message-Oriented Open Architecture (MOAR) Specification defines a language-agnostic and cloud provider agnostic architecture for humans to describe and build a distributed system that is easy to maintain and extend. When properly used, an architect can use the defined protocol to communicate intent to developers, and developers can implement the system without knowing the details of all its intricate parts.

The MOAR architecture can be used with tools to generate documentation and to run simulation of your system before its put in production.
