## Versions

The MOAR Specification is versioned using [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and follows the semver specification.

The `major` part of semver is incremented when a change is introduced to this specification that is not backwards compatible with previous versions. For example, the name format specification of functions is changed so tools will stop functioning with this new version.

The `minor` part of semver is incremented when a new feature is introduced to the specification that still makes it bakcwards compatible with previous versions. For example, a new symbol is introduced to indicate services of different networks.

The `patch` part of semver is incremented when there is a fix to the specification that doesn't change its meaning. For example, a spelling error or clarification.
